# Reel Savings Challenge

### Live: https://reel-savings-react.cohencodes.now.sh/

This is my take on a coding challenge to create the frontend UI / UX for an app that needed to display a users list of items they are saving for. My approach was to display this information in a compact and minimal way, and providing all necessary information with a quick glance. The users are able to filter through active, paused, or completed items, as well as search for any items. I also implemented a dark mode feature as well.
